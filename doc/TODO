 - Code refactoring/ceaning/testing
 - Performance Enhancements

Refactoring
 - restrict tag names to alphanumeric-_

Bug
 - loading next page after marking some read
 - fix folders sortable + dropable

winnow:
 * use schema.rb or squash migrations so they are consistent with the production db
 * vendor mysql, libxml-ruby
 * test server with passenger
rails:
 * for unpack type
 * for unpacking non-frozen gems that think they are frozen
 ! gems:build tries to install/unpack first
 ! don't load gems when $gems_rake_task
 ! gems:install:dependencies - add this task (why does it install frozen dependencies sometimes? - diff-lcs)
 ! error on builder form some reason when runnign in cruise and not installed
 ! gems:refresh_specs adds bin
selenium-client:
 * merged changes into mvanholstyn/selenium-client repo, need to push back upstream
 * http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ruby/
mhs testing:
 * loading issue on rake task
 * update
 * remove at_exit requires
 * remove spec_helper requires

refactoring:
 * remove inline javascript
 * remove rjs files
   * app/views/feeds/create.js.rjs
   * app/views/feeds/globally_exclude.js.rjs
   * app/views/folders/add_item.js.rjs
   * app/views/folders/create.js.rjs
   * app/views/folders/destroy.js.rjs
   * app/views/tags/create.js.rjs
   * app/views/tags/destroy.js.rjs # TODO: Fade and remove
   * app/views/tags/error.js.rjs
   * app/views/tags/globally_exclude.js.rjs
   * app/views/tags/merge.js.rjs
   * app/views/tags/rename.js.rjs
   * app/views/tags/sidebar.js.rjs
   * app/views/tags/subscribe.js.rjs
   * app/views/tags/unsubscribe.js.rjs
 * refactor application.js, item_browser.js, sidebar.js, content.js, feed_items_item_browser.js, item.js
 * removing a tag should fade then remove (sidebar, training control)
 * insertInOrder should be able to appear

winnow:
 * Add missing indexes on ids
 * styling of headers when (partially) selected
 * detect back button and reload feed items
 * Remember selected item/scroll state when returning to the feed item display

rails:
 * js/css min

rspec:
 * helper specs broken (then upgrade helper specs in winnow)

prototype/scripty:
 * ?

itembrowser:
 * endless page plugin
