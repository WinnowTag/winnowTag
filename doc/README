h1. Running Winnow

Winnow can be run by itself, however it is often useful to run the other peices in conjunction with winnow to enable all of winnow's features.

h2. Winnow

A simple script/server will do.

h2. Collector

In order to be able to add and import feeds, the collector must be running. The collector can also be run with a simple script/server -p 4000, however a port must be specified so that it does not conflict with Winnow's port. Winnow must be told the url of the classifier by creating config/collector.conf which simply has the url (eg. http://localhost:4000).

h2. Classifier

In order to be able to classify items in Winnow, the classifier must be running. The classifier also requires that the tokenizer is running.

classifier-tools/bin/tokenizer -p 8009
classifier/src/classifier --port 8008 -t 0.9 --log-file classifier.log --tokenizer-url http://localhost:8009/tokenize  --tag-index http://localhost:3000/tags.atom --db <item_cache_dir>

h2. Sumary

echo "http://localhost:4000" > winnow/config/collector.conf; cd collector; script/server -p 4000
cd winnow; script/server
classifier-tools/bin/tokenizer -p 8009
classifier/src/classifier --port 8008 -t 0.9 --log-file classifier.log --tokenizer-url http://localhost:8009/tokenize  --tag-index http://localhost:3000/tags.atom --db <item_cache_dir>
