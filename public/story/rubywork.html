<h1>Ruby + Rails developer: Personalized content
  filtering &amp; collaborative moderation</h1> 

<p><em>This is the  contract opportunity described in our  <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/sfc/eng/129408576.html">Craig's
      List posting</a>. But how could we speak to the Ruby community
      in such a stilted and bureacratic fashion? Here we are more to
  the point and  clearly state our requirement of Ruby experience.</em></p>
<p>Peerworks.org is a foundation funded non-profit. We're boosting the scope
  and power of online social interaction with specific open source projects.
  Intelligent personalized content filtering is our near term focus. We need
  an experienced independent Ruby + Rails contractor to make a strong and well
  defined commitment to our work. Compensation is competitive. We're looking
for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Significant Ruby work</strong></li>
  <li>Visible expertise in open source development</li>
  <li>Passion for the constructive
    social potential of the web</li>
</ul>

<p>We have no office! We are completely web coordinated. Have you worked in a
  distributed development team? Hours are flexible, but we need a clearly scheduled
  and very substantial commitment to our projects. Recent graduates are welcome &mdash; we
  hire on merit, not seniority. Please email your resume and direct us to current
    examples of your work. If there&rsquo;s a possible match, we&rsquo;ll contact
    you. Thanks!</p>
