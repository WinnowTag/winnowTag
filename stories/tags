Story: Tag Feeds

  As a Feed consumer
  I want to access feeds for each tag
  So that I can read them
  
  Scenario: Accessing a feed for a public tag
  
    Given a public tag in the system
  
    When I access /tags/public/username/tag_id.atom  
    
    Then the response is 200
    And the body is parseable by ratom
    And the content type is atom
