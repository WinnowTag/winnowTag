  # The majority of your configuration should be in <tt>config/moonshine.yml</tt>
  # If necessary, you may provide extra configuration directly in this class
  # using the configure method. The hash passed to the configure method is deep
  # merged with what is in <tt>config/moonshine.yml</tt>. This could be used,
  # for example, to store passwords and/or private keys outside of your SCM, or
  # to query a web service for configuration data.
  #
  # In the example below, the value configuration[:custom][:random] can be used in
  # your moonshine settings or templates.
  #
  # require 'net/http'
  # require 'json'
  # random = JSON::load(Net::HTTP.get(URI.parse('http://twitter.com/statuses/public_timeline.json'))).last['id']
  # configure({
  #   :custom => { :random => random  }
  # })

  # The default_stack recipe install Rails, Apache, Passenger, the database from
  # database.yml, Postfix, Cron, logrotate and NTP. See lib/moonshine/manifest/rails.rb
