= FiveRuns TuneUp Plugin (panel)

== Requirements

* Rails 2.0.1+
* Firefox 2.0+, Safari 3.1+.  IE support is on the roadmap.

== Synopsis

Display call stack information on Rails requests.

*THIS IS A BETA RELEASE*; the normal disclaimers apply.

== Installation

Install the gem:

  sudo gem install fiveruns_tuneup
  
For Rails 2.0, install the plugin into +vendor/plugins+:
  
  fiveruns_tuneup /path/to/app
  (or you can clone the GitHub repo into vendor/plugins)
  
For Rails 2.1, you can use it as a gem dependency instead; in your +environment.rb+:

  config.gem 'fiveruns_tuneup'
  
Note: At the current time (as of the 2.1 release) there are issues in Rails that prevent
the plugin running as an unpacked gem (via +rake gems:unpack+).
  
== Configuration

By default, TuneUp only displays the panel and instruments your application
in the +development+ environment.  If you'd like to configure it to run in the +production+
environment (for testing), you can create a +RAILS_ROOT/config/tuneup.rb+ file:

  Fiveruns::Tuneup.config do |config|
    config.environments << :production
  end
