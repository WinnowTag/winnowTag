= RedCloth 4.0

* New SuperRedCloth (RedCloth 4.0) is a total rewrite using Ragel for the parsing.
* Markdown support has been removed.
* Single newlines become <br> tags, just as in traditional RedCloth and other Textile parsers.
* HTML special characters are automatically escaped inside code signatures, like Textile 2.  This means you can simply write @<br />@ and the symbols are escaped whereas in RedCloth 3 you had to write @&lt;br /&gt;@ to make the code fragment readable.
* The restrictions parameter is observed just like previous versions (except :hard_breaks is now the default).
* Arguments to RedCloth#to_html are called so extensions made for prior versions can work.  Note: extensions need to be included rather than defined directly within the RedCloth class as was previously possible.
* Custom block tags can be implemented as in the previous version, though the means of implementing them differs.
* HTML embedded in the Textile input does not often need to be escaped from Textile parsing.
* The parser will not wrap lines that begin with a space in paragraph tags.
* Rudimentary support for LaTeX is built in.
* RedCloth::VERSION on a line by itself inserts the version number into the output.
* Output (less newlines and tabs) is identical to Textile 2 except a few cases where the RedCloth
  way was preferable.
* Over 500 tests prevent regression
* It's 40 times faster than the previous version.
