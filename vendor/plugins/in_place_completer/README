= InPlaceEditor with Autocompletion

This plugin provides two new Ajax-controls that makes it possible
to have In-Place-Editing fields with either Local or Remote autocompletion.

If you want to use this in your view, first make sure you have something
like this in your <head> tag:

    <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
    <%= in_place_completer_include %>

If you want to use the remote completer, all you need to do is the same 
as for a regular autocompleting field, or inplaceeditor:

    <%= in_place_completing_editor_field :object, :field %>

This will generate a field that autocompletes with the action
auto_complete_for_object_field.

If you want local completions, you can add it in this way:

    <%= in_place_local_completing_editor_field :object, :field, %w(value1 value2 value3 value4) %>

For more information, check the RDoc for these methods, and 
in_place_editor_completer and in_place_editor_local_completer.
