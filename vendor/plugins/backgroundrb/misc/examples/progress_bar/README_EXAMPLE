In this example directory is all the code for a simple worker with 
an ajax progress bar. Just copy the appropriate files to the right 
place in a rails app and play with the sample.

Included files:
drb_controller.rb #goes in the app/controllers dir
drb/ # goes in app/views/ dir
drb.css goes # goes in public/stylesheets
drb.js # goes in public/javascripts
progress_worker.rb # goes in lib/workers

You will need to include links to the css and js in your layout.
