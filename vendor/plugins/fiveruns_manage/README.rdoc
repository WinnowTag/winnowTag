Product: http://fiveruns.com/products/manage
Gem Repository: http://gems.fiveruns.com

== Summary

Targets plugin used to report metrics to the
FiveRuns Manage service, http://fiveruns.com/products/manage

== Installation

  install fiveruns_manage --source http://gems.fiveruns.com

Then install the plugin into your application:

  fiveruns_manage /path/to/app
  
Or, if you're using Rails 2.1, you can just add the gem as a dependency
in your +config/environment.rb+:

  config.gem 'fiveruns_manage'

For more information, see the help documentation at https://help.fiveruns.com/manage/fiveruns-manage-guide/

== Updates

Once you install the new gem, just:

  fiveruns_manage /path/to/app

(Note, if you're using Rails 2.1 with the gem as a dependency, this step isn't required)

For more information, see the help documentation at https://help.fiveruns.com/manage/fiveruns-manage-guide/

== Configuration

You can define the behavior of the plugin by creating
a configuration file at +RAILS_ROOT/config/manage.rb+

Example, showing how to force the plugin to only load in "production" and "staging" environments:

 Fiveruns::Manage::Plugin.configure do |config|
   config.environments = %w(production staging)
 end

== Advanced Settings

=== Instrumented Scripts
  
By default, the plugin will attempt load unless the script that is running is one of:
  * script/runner
  * rake

You can force the plugin to skip loading if you set ENV['LOAD_FIVERUNS_MANAGE'] to false
before the Rails environment is loaded.
